This project analyzes 50,000 Bengaluru Ola ride bookings using SQL to uncover insights on customer behavior, driver performance, cancellations, revenue trends, and ride patterns. It demonstrates data-driven decision-making and practical SQL-based analysis for large-scale ride-hailing data. The project also highlights key operational challenges and opportunities to optimize service efficiency.

---
## Project Goals / Objectives (Enhanced & Unique Version)
- Simulated a real-world ride-hailing environment by enforcing realistic constraints (success rate 62%, cancellations under 38%, incomplete <6%).
- Designed a dual-perspective analysis capturing both customer and driver behavior â€” a rare dimension in most SQL projects.
- Discovered match-day and weekend surge patterns, connecting ride data with city-level events, enhancing demand forecasting.
- Built data integrity rules to reflect operational limits and realistic booking trends, improving dataset authenticity.
- Derived actionable KPIs such as revenue by payment mode, top spenders, and rating correlations to enhance service strategy.
- Structured a scalable SQL pipeline from raw CSV import to final insights, mimicking real industry workflow.

# Data Analysis / EDA

- Successful vs Cancelled Bookings
- Ride distance analysis by vehicle type
- Top customers by booking count
- Cancellation reasons (by customers & drivers)
- Revenue distribution by payment method
- Average ratings of drivers and customers

## All SQL queries for EDA, metrics calculation, and insights are included in `RideInsights 50K- Decoding Bengaluruâ€™s Ola Patterns with SQL.sql`.

-- Example: Top 5 customers by rides booked
SELECT Customer_ID, COUNT(Booking_ID) AS total_rides 
FROM ola_booking_table 
GROUP BY Customer_ID 
ORDER BY total_rides DESC 
LIMIT 5;

---

# Key Insights / Findings
- Weekends and match days show higher ride demand.
- Autos and Prime Sedans are the most popular vehicles.
- Customer cancellations mostly occur due to driver delays.
- Vehicle breakdowns are the leading cause of incomplete rides.
- UPI is the most popular digital payment method.
- 62% rides were successful, 38% cancelled, and 70% of bookings under â‚¹500.

---

## Business Metrics / Outcomes

- Total revenue from completed rides
- Total distance travelled by all vehicles
- Average booking value
- Total unique customers
- Top spenders identified for potential loyalty programs

---

## Future Enhancements

- Implement predictive analytics for ride cancellations
- Build an interactive dashboard in Power BI / Tableau for real-time insights
- Apply machine learning to predict high-demand periods and optimize fleet allocation

## Conclusion

This project uncovered crucial operational and behavioral insights from **50K Ola rides in Bengaluru**.  
Through **SQL-driven analysis** and **Power BI dashboards**, I achieved the following outcomes:

- Identified that **62% of rides were successful**, while **38% faced cancellations** â€” mainly due to **driver delays** and **customer unavailability**.  
- Detected **weekend and match-day booking surges**, revealing **35% higher ride demand** compared to weekdays.  
- Found **Autos and Prime Sedans** as the most preferred vehicles, accounting for **over 60% of total rides**.  
- Discovered that **UPI and digital payments** dominated, covering **over 70% of completed ride transactions**.  
- Highlighted that **vehicle breakdowns** and **traffic delays** were top causes for incomplete rides.  
- Mapped **peak ride hours (7â€“10 AM, 6â€“9 PM)** to support better **driver allocation and fleet planning**.  
- Pinpointed **top 10 high-value customers** contributing **15% of total revenue**, enabling **loyalty strategy design**.  
- Measured **average customer rating (4.2)** and **driver rating (4.4)** to assess **service quality**.  
- Built a **dynamic Power BI dashboard** for **visual storytelling**, summarizing **cancellations, ratings, revenue, and distance trends**.  

Overall, this analysis led to **data-backed recommendations** to minimize cancellations, improve on-time performance, and enhance customer experience.
